Things to prove:
* From the electron interface, have a button that can initiate some fetch and display of data about the printer.


Features still needed:
* There needs to be a public browser landing page and an electron.js page
* The electron.js page will be more oriented towards viewing the 3D print queue and initiating a print
* The logged in browser view page will allow selecting a type of splint and then inputing the needed parameters of that splint. Each type of defined splint will have its own page with a form for collecting the needed inputs.
