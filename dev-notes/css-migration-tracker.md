# CSS Migration Tracker

_Operational progress log for the CSS standardization effort._

## How to Use This File

**Starting a session:** Read the In Progress and the first few Not Started rows to understand where things stand. No other context needed.

**Completing a page:** Check off the per-page items, move the row to Done, and note the date. If something unexpected came up (a pattern not covered by the plan, a visual breakage that needed fixing), add a short note — this is how the plan improves over time.

**Adding new pages:** If a new page is created, add it to Not Started immediately. Migration happens when the page is first touched for real work.

## Status Key

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[ ]` | Not started |
| `[~]` | In progress |
| `[x]` | Done |

Per-page checklist items (abbreviated from the plan):
- **A** — Remove dead dark/light machinery (`dark:` variants, `isDarkMode` JS)
- **B** — Replace presentational bg/text/border Tailwind classes with semantic classes
- **C** — Replace status badge color pairs with `.status-badge .status-{state}`
- **D** — Add `data-testid` attributes
- **V** — Visual verification pass

## Shared Components (migrate before or alongside pages that use them)

| Component | A | B | C | D | V | Notes |

## globals.css Shim Removal Checklist

_The `!important` override block in globals.css can be removed only after these are all confirmed migrated:_

- [ ] All pages above marked done
- [ ] Header, PrinterStatusBanner, ReloadButton migrated
- [ ] No remaining `bg-white`, `bg-gray-50`, `text-gray-900`, `text-gray-600` in JSX (run grep to verify)
- [ ] `:root.light` block removed from globals.css
- [ ] Tailwind override shim block removed from globals.css

## Lessons Learned / Plan Amendments

_Add notes here when a migration reveals something the plan didn't anticipate._

| Date | Finding |
|---|---|
| 2026-04-09 | **`group`/`group-hover:` color classes are unremapped** — the globals.css shim catches `.text-blue-600` but not `.group-hover\:text-blue-600`. Use CSS parent-child hover rules in semantic.css instead. |
| 2026-04-09 | **Component classes own complete visual treatment** — `.page-title` and `.design-card-title` include font-size and font-weight, not just color. JSX doesn't need `text-3xl font-bold` alongside `.page-title`. Plan updated. |
| 2026-04-09 | **`hover:border-blue-300`/`hover:text-blue-700` also unremapped** — any `hover:`, `focus:`, `group-hover:` Tailwind color variant is not covered by the shim. Always use semantic CSS for hover color changes. |
