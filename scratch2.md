Price for maximizing learning, that means probably leaving some money on the table which increases the opportunity to learn.
    * Demand validation is more important
    * Earn the right to start optimizing price
    * mike Gaugin story
    * TinyPulse - employee engagement stuff. David got acquired
    * Steve Hammerslag - something fax related "How many people push back on the price" None "You're pricing it too low"
        * Rule of 85 - If 85% of clients are accepting your price and 15% are pushing back, your price is good.
    * If you raise your price, everyone wins. More money available to improve systems
    * David raised his price for new customers.
* "Anchoring" provide a high price option that puts the other prices in a better light. 
* "Precision Heuristic" is a cognitive bias where people subconsciously assume that specific numbers are more accurate (the $19,730 vs 20,000) see: Columbia Pricing Study
    * Avoid 0s and 5s and the end of your price
    * Use numbers like 3, 7, or 9 (eg $4270 is better than $4250; 4273 is even better)
    * justify the precision. If asked be ready to show the line items that led to that exact figure
* "Assortments" (Vimeo) help capture more of the market demand "Market Customization". Product variations are cheap to founders and helpful to customers

* Live Pricing and Packaging Clinic
    * Examples from participants
        * Dental office check in kiosk (iPad based) mobile apps
    * "Fallacy of long trial periods" - If free trial goes too long, people procrastinate about trying the product. 
        * "Token" or credit based free trial, use based trial

* BANT
    * IBM's sale process (BANT)
        * Budget - Can they afford it
            * Dicuss pricing aranges and ROI early. Check for allocated funds

        * Authority - Who makes the decisions
        * Need - What is their pain
            * Ask open-ended questions, quantify the impact of the challenge
        * Timeline - When will they buy?

* Sales Live Role Play
    * Boaz will pitch Clause.so
    * David is a GC (general council)
    * Boaz had some good action questions
        * Find the decision maker, ask about past purchases and how the process went. "When you find a tool that helps you how do you get to actually use it and purchase it?"
        * "Let's get our calendars out" - This is the most important thing.
        * Talk ratio should lean towards the prospect
        * Mindset "I am not selling you something, I am solving your problems"

David Niu's Prospective Customer Questions (see: https://community.supersmall.ai/c/fs3-pricing-packaging-and-sales/fs3-supersales-breakout-into-groups-to-role-play):

1. THE OPENER (Set the Stage & Take Control)
"Thanks for making the time. To make the most of our [X] minutes, I’d love to learn a bit about your current situation, share how we benefit clients, and then decide together if it makes sense to explore further. Does that agenda sound okay to you?"
"I know we connected briefly online, but to kick us off—what was the specific trigger that made you want to book this conversation today?"
"To ensure this call is valuable for you, what is the one thing you absolutely need to walk away knowing by the end of our time together?"

2. NEED (Uncover Pain & Impact)
"Can you walk me through your current process for handling [specific problem area]?"
"What is the single biggest bottleneck or frustration your team is facing with that current process?"
"If you don't solve this problem in the next 6 months, what is the likely impact on the business (or your team's goals)?"
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how satisfied are you with the status quo?"
"If you could wave a magic wand and fix just one thing about your current workflow, what would it be?"

3. TIMING (Establish Urgency)
"Is there a specific internal deadline or external event that you are trying to get this solution in place for?"
"Why is it important to solve this now rather than waiting until next quarter or next year?"
"If we found the perfect solution today, realistically, when would you want to be live and running with it?"
"What else is on your plate right now that might compete for attention with getting this project done?"


4. AUTHORITY (Map the Buying Committee)
"Can you walk me through how your company typically evaluates and buys software like ours? What are the usual steps?"
"Besides yourself, who else on the team is most impacted by this problem and needs to be part of the conversation?"
"Is there anyone else who would feel left out, or even upset, if they weren't involved in seeing a demo before a decision is made?"
"When you've bought similar tools in the past, who ultimately had to sign off on the final agreement?"

5. BUDGET (Confirm Resources)
"Do you have a specific budget allocated for this project already, or are you still in the gathering information phase to request funds?"
"We typically see companies of your size investing between $[X] and $[Y] annually for a solution like this. Is that within the realm of what you were expecting?"
"Is this purchase already budgeted for this fiscal year, or would this require approval for net-new funds?"
"If we can prove the ROI we discussed earlier, do you foresee any major hurdles in securing the budget?"

6. THE CLOSE (Secure Concrete Next Steps)
"Based on what you've told me today, it sounds like we could really help solve [their main pain point]. Do you agree?"
"Is there any reason we shouldn't move forward to the next step of a tailored demo for your team?"
"The logical next step is usually a 45-minute deep dive with [Specific Stakeholder Name]. Do you have your calendar handy to get that booked right now?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that our solution is the right fit for what you need right now?"
